This project consists of an AI that trains against itself to play a 1v1 Texas Hold'em Poker game (simplified with only 2 betting rounds and 3 community cards). 

There are two distinct folders that accomplish slightly different goals:

- Poker (No ML) is a program that allows a user to play against a hard-coded computer player that does not use machine learning. The user interacts with the game through a graphical interface made with pygame.
- Poker AI is a program that trains two machine learning agents by having them play against each other. The user can pit two different AI agents with varying amounts of training against each other or the user can play against an AI agent through the console of an IDE.
